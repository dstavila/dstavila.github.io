title: Data Definition Language (DDL)
---

During development of one of my companies project it became obvious that we need some quick code generation solution. At first I only wanted code-gen our commands (systems that were used to communicate between different modules).

So for fist iteration I created scriptable object that contained:
* group
* field name
* type
* default value

Output example:
```
namespace Commands
{
  public static class ConstantNames
  {
    public const string sTesto = "Testo";
  }
  public static class Constants
  {
    public static readonly int Testo = Animator.StringToHash(ConstantNames.sTesto);
  }
  [Serializable]
  public class Testo : CommandHeader
  {
    // Fields
    public string Commandify()
    {
      id = Constants.Testo;
      name = ConstantNames.sTesto;
    }
  }
}
```

Later we required code-gen for Unity and C++ part (some some interop stuff), so I came up of idea of creating DDL language that will be doing codegen for both langs.
Additionaly Animator.StringToHash(...) is kinda Unity only, and we needed better solution. So instead of using it we eneded up using MurmurHash32, so example above got transformed into:
```
...
public static class Constants
{
  public static const int Testo = <HASH_VALUE>; // where hash_value is MurmurHash32(Constants.Testo)
}
...
```

Additionally I've got some inspiration from [Mike Acton's DDLParser](https://github.com/macton/DDLParser) library. So we created attribute for enums that will be computing hashes for it's values. 
In order to implement DDL quickly I decided to use C# language, it has all of reflection, bells and whistles to do this quickly.

Enum example:
```
/// DDL
[Select]
public enum ETesto
{
  kUnknown = 0,
  kTesto,
}

/// C#
public enum ETesto : uint
{
  kUnknown = 0,
  kTesto == 122303781, // note, that's not actual value, just an example
}
```

Using this kind of enums allows to add values in without worrying that they will change their order in Unity inspector.


## Second command gen iteration
This time around we though that we can do stuff little bit differently. For cmd-gen I wanted little bit different approach. Here's an example
```
/// DDL
namespace DDL
{
  [Command] void Testo(bool flag, int val);
}

/// C#
namespace DDL
{
  public enum ECommands
  {
    kUnknown = 0,
    Testo = MurmurHash32(DDL.Testo), // Note that I'm precomputing actual value here.
  }
  [Serializable]
  public class Testo : CommandHeader
  {
    public bool flag;
    public int val;
    public Testo()
    {
      id = ECommands.Testo;
      name = "Commands.Testo";
    }
  }
}
```

Note that name is for debug purposes, and can be removed in retail builds.


## Extending DDL to C++ json serialization/deserialization
Since C# part has reflection and both Unity JsonConvert and Newtonsoft.Json libs can auto serialize/deserialize stuff output for structures defined in DDL for C# code are just plain structs. We didn't need to reinvent something here. Fun stuff happening on C++ side though.
```
/// DDL
public class Testo
{
  int Id;
  bool Flag;
}
/// DDL_Generated.h
struct Testo
{
  i32 Id;
  bool Flag;

  static std::string to_json(const Testo * self);
  static bool from_json(const std::string & json, Testo * self);
}
```

Note C++ output is omitted, but I'm using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to deserialize stuff. You can check details [here](https://github.com/dstavila/ddlc), just note code is really messy, I needed it working, and I needed it fast. So dont judge about code quality.


In general this approach worked perfectly for our case. Precaulculating stuff in offline mode is awesome.
